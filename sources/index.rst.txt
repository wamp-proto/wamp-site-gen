Welcome to the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)!

WAMP is an open application level protocol that provides two
messaging patterns:

* Routed **Remote Procedure Calls** and
* **Publish & Subscribe**

uses different serializers for message encoding, like:

* `JSON <https://www.json.org>`_
* `MessagePack <https://msgpack.org/>`_
* `FlatBuffers <https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/>`_
* `CBOR <https://cbor.io/>`_
* and many others

and can run over different transports, like:

* `WebSocket <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455>`_ `subprotocol <https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml>`_
* Raw TCP Socket
* Unix domain socket

The WAMP protocol is a community effort and the specification is made available for
free under an open license for everyone to use or implement. The original design
and proposal was created by `Crossbar.io <https://crossbar.io>`_ developers in 2012 and
WAMP development is sponsored since then by `Crossbar.io (the company) <https://crossbario.com>`_.
