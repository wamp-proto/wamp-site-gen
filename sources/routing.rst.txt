.. _Routing:

Message Routing in WAMP
=======================

-------

WAMP provides `Unified Application Routing`_ in an open `WebSocket protocol`_
that works with `different`_ languages.


Using WAMP you can build distributed systems out of application components
which are **loosely coupled** and communicate in (soft) **real-time**.


At its core, WAMP offers two communication patterns for application components
to talk to each other:

- `Publish & Subscribe`_ (PubSub)
- `Remote Procedure Calls`_ (RPC)


We think applications often have a natural `need for both forms of
communication`_ and shouldn't be required to use different protocols/means
for those. Which is why WAMP provides both.


WAMP is easy to use, simple to implement and based on modern Web standards:
WebSocket, JSON and URIs.


While WAMP isn't exactly rocket science, we believe it's good engineering and
a major step forward in practice that allows developers to create more powerful
applications with less complexity and in less time.


.. _Unified Application Routing:

Loosely coupled
---------------

WAMP provides what we call **unified Application Routing** for application
communication:

* routing of events in the Publish & Subscriber pattern and
* routing of calls  in the Remote Procedure Call pattern

between applications components in *one* protocol.

Unified routing is probably best explained by contrasting it with legacy
approaches.

Lets take the old "client-server" world. In the client-server model, a
remote procedure call goes directly from the *Caller* to the *Callee*:

    Remote procedure calls in the **Client-Server** model

In the client-server model, a *Caller* needs to have knowledge about where
the *Callee* resides and how to reach it. This introduces a strong coupling
between *Caller* and *Callee*. Which is bad, because applications can quickly
become complex and unmaintainable. We explain how WAMP fixes that in a minute.

The problems coming from strong coupling between application components were
long recognized and this (besides other requirements) lead to the
publish-subscribe model.

In the publish-subscribe model a *Publisher* submits information to an
abstract "topic", and *Subscribers* only receive information indirectly
by announcing their interest on a respective "topic".
Both do not know about each other. They are decoupled via the "topic" and
via an intermediary usually called *Broker*:

.. figure:: static/gen/unified_routing_pubsub_broker.svg
    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :alt: A Broker decouples *Publishers* and *Subscribers*
    :figclass: align-center

    A Broker decouples *Publishers* and *Subscribers*

A *Broker* keeps a book of subscriptions: who is currently subscribed on
which topic. When a *Publisher* publishes some information ("event") to
a topic, the *Broker* will look up who is currently subscribed on
that topic: determine the set of *Subscribers* on the topic published
to. And then forward the information ("event") to all those *Subscribers*.

The act of determining receivers of information (independently of the
information submitted) and forwarding the information to receivers is
called *routing*.

Now, WAMP translates the benefits of loose coupling to RPC. Different from
the client-server model, WAMP also decouples *Callers* and *Callees* by
introducing an intermediary - the *Dealer*:

.. figure:: static/gen/unified_routing_rpc_dealer.svg
    :align: center
    :width: 50%
    :alt: Remote procedure calls in the **Dealer** model
    :figclass: align-center

    Remote procedure calls in the **Dealer** model

Similar to a *Broker's* role with PubSub, the *Dealer* is responsible for
routing a call originating from the *Caller* to the *Callee* and route back
results or errors vice-versa. Both do not know about each other: where the
peer resides and how to reach it. This knowledge is encapsulated in
the *Dealer*

With WAMP, a *Callee* registers a procedure at a *Dealer* under an abstract
name: a URI identifying the procedure. When a *Caller* wants to call a remote
procedure, it talks to the *Dealer* and only provides the URI of the
procedure to be called plus any call arguments. The *Dealer* will
look up the procedure to be invoked in his book of registered procedures.
The information from the book includes *where* the *Callee* implementing
the procedure resides, and how to reach it.

In effect, *Callers* and *Callees* are decoupled, and applications can use
RPC and still benefit from loose coupling.


Component based
---------------

**Brokers, Dealers and Routers**

What if you combine a Broker (for Publish & Subscribe) and a Dealer (for
routed Remote Procedure Calls)?

When you combine a *Broker* and a *Dealer* you get what WAMP calls a *Router*:

.. figure:: static/gen/unified_routing_broker_dealer.svg
    :align: center
    :width: 70%
    :alt: A **Router** combines a Broker and a Dealer
    :figclass: align-center

    A **Router** combines a Broker and a Dealer

A *Router* is capable of routing both calls and events, and hence can support
flexible, decoupled architectures that use both RPC and PubSub. We think this
is new. And a good thing.

Here is an example. Imagine you have a small embedded device like an Arduino
Yun with sensors (like a temperature sensor) and actuators (like a light or
motor) connected. And you want to integrate the device into an overall
system with user facing frontend to control the actuators, and continuously
process sensor values in a backend component.

Using WAMP, you can have a browser-based UI, the embedded device and your
backend talk to each other in real-time:

    :width: 80%

    :figclass: align-center

    WAMP in an IoT application

Switching on a light on the device from the browser-based UI is naturally done
by calling a remote procedure on the device (1). And the sensor values
generated by the device continuously are naturally transmitted to the backend
component (and possibly others) via publish & subscribe (2).

.. note::

    "Moving onto the part of Internet of Things, we integrated a sensor (light sensor) and
    an actuator (light switch/dimmer) into a web application. The major feature of the
    sensor (sending data) and that of the actuator (commanding and configuration) perfectly
    match the messaging patterns, Pub/Sub and RPC, which WAMP provides."

**So here you have it: one protocol fulfilling "all" application
communication needs.**

.. _WebSocket protocol:

Real-time
---------

`WebSocket <http://crossbario.com/blog/Websocket-Why-What-Can-I-Use-It/>`_ is a
new Web protocol that overcomes limitations of HTTP when bidirectional,
real-time communication is required.


WebSocket is specified as an `IETF standard <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455>`_
and built into `modern browsers <https://caniuse.com/#search=websocket>`_.


When designing WAMP, we recognized early on that WebSocket would be the ideal
basis for WAMP as it provides bidirectional real-time messaging that is
compatible with the Web and browsers. Not only that - we can run WebSocket
with non-browser environments as well.


However, as such, WebSocket it is quite low-level and only provides raw
messaging. This is where WAMP enters. WAMP adds the higher level messaging
patterns of RPC and PubSub to WebSocket.


Technically, WAMP is an `officially registered <http://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml#subprotocol-name>`_ **WebSocket subprotocol** (runs on top of WebSocket)
that uses `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_ as message serialization format.


While WAMP-over-WebSocket with JSON serialization is the preferred transport
for WAMP, the protocol can also run with `MsgPack <http://msgpack.org/>`_ as
serialization, run over raw-TCP or generally any message based, bidirectional,
reliable transport.


**Hence: WAMP runs on the Web and anywhere else.**


.. _different:

Language independent
--------------------

WAMP was designed with first-class support for `different languages`_ in
mind (*). Nothing in WAMP is specific to a single programming language. As
soon as a programming language has a WAMP implementation, it can talk to
application components written *in any other language* with WAMP support.
Transparently.

.. note::

    WAMP has facilities for first-class support of many common and less common
    language features. E.g. WAMP can transmit both positional and keyword based
    call arguments, so that languages which natively support keyword arguments
    in functions (e.g. Python) can be naturally mapped. WAMP even supports
    multi-positional and keywords based **return** values for calls. E.g. the
    PostgreSQL pgPL/SQL or Oracle PL/SQL languages support this. Means that
    most PL/SQL functions can be naturally exposed via WAMP.


The ability to create a system from application components written in different
languages is a big advantage. You can write your frontend in JavaScript to run
in the browser, but still write backend components in Python or Java. If you
recognize a performance bottleneck in a component, you can rewrite that
component in a faster language - without changing a single line of code in
other components.


All developers in your team can become productive, since they are not tied to
a "least common denominator", but can write components in the language they
prefer, or which is ideal for the specific components at hand. Need some
fancy numerical code which is only available in C++ and needs to run with
maximum performance? No problem. Have the functionality isolated in an
application component written in C++, and integrate this with components
written in your "standard" language.


**What this means is: plug-and-play your app components - no matter what
language.**
